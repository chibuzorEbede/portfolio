## This is my portfolio website built with next js

## next thing to do

1. add page transitions
2. add the process animation on the homepage. This could be multimedia based you know.
3. see how the homepage could be 100vh with no scrolls
4. fix the styled cursor glitch, its not responding well on hovering over menu buttons
5. load fonts locally? is this good practice?
6. in about check the text line height. is it optimal?
7. fix cursor
8. in posts mark selected post active
9. in projects, make card footer nicer. make equal spacing between the elements
10. add email to homepage
11. add all links; posts menu socials

## glitches in mobile mode

1. when a page is active clicking its link does not close the menu, menu should always close on click of any menu item.
   2.menu box animation should work two ways.
   3.on posts page; instead on thoughts, a little intro to my blog in small fonts up there. or just change font size between blog name(thoughts) and blog title
2. see if we can add a little fancy animation on scroll for the pages. it should be highly performant, if not leave it.
3. make project card look like full-screen with footer and background shadow.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
